## Introduction 

### Concept
Finding the right neigborhood in a new city is difficult. A service providing insight to people desiering to live in a global metropol will benfit from current trends: More employees are willing to move abroad and more employers willing to hire from other countries. 

The willingness to move abroad is increasing. Over 70% of millennials are willing to relocate their lives to a foreign country according to [pwc](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/people-organisation/publications/workforce-of-the-future.html). In the next five years millenials will be more than 50% of the work force. This means 

For skilled labor the oportunites to find work abrod is better than ever. Sosial networks like LinkedIn matches candidates with opportunites cross borders. International assosiations make personal networks more global. For Data Scientists there are global organizations like NumFOCUS and international confrences like SciPy.

An easy way to identify certain types of neigbourhoods in different large global metropols will benefit those willing to move.  With enough trafic the service could add premium features like comparing living costs (including rent specific to a neighbourhood). Searching for neighbourhoods with transport options. Adding fun features like ratings and summaries could be used to increase the amount of trafic and plublicity.

### Possible pivot
Finding the right neigborhood when visiting a new city is a similar problem. Preferences are likely to be different. Living and workign som where is not the same as 

AirBNB lowers the cost of staying abroad for medium time periods. With the possiblity of renting a functional home the cost of living is reduced. The combination of lower rent and the option of preparing food at home both reduce cost. In addition, some have the option of rention out their own home while staying abroud. 

### Air BnB
Ari bnb has mad renting in new neighborhoods an option. The number of reviews are not as high as for hotels. The quality ensuracne is less than for a chain. This means new placec to rent often come at a discount. 

How can a traveler figure out which neigborhood without reading revies.

No revies possible.

Deciding on a neigborhood is hard. Ny City has 300+ neigboorhods. If you are certain you want to live in Manhattan the number of options are reduced, but hte prices are higher

Making this a proof of concept. 

Sum of venues, then we use PCP to gain insight.

The first component gives busy not busy when only using the local venues
The second puts it at residential not residential? If not we can stic with busy not busy

Then using the travel time to the venues in other neigborhoods we can get how connected a neigborhood is.

Lots of extention posibilites for the service. Crime rates, avrage rent. AirBNB does have API but it's not public.
