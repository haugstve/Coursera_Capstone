## Introduction 

AirBNB makes it possible to rent apartments in cities. At the moment there are 2000+ apartments in New York available for rent during the first weekend in June. These are located in 122 h. Finding the best deal is far from trivial.

The manual approach for selecting an apartment relies on the filter provided by the webpages. Without prior preferences on the neighborhood the selection process is daunting. Sifting through a few apartments from each neighborhood to get a feel for the local area would take hours. Then when the number of neighborhoods is reduced to a more manageable number the task of picking an  still remains. 

For new  there are no reviews available. Information regarding the neighborhood is provided by the owner. This makes it hard to make informed decisions without already knowing the city. The lack of reviews makes  that are less popular. This is reflected in the rent, which means the best deals are among those apartments. 

Using machine learning to identify key information from different neighborhoods would ease the decision. Choosing the right neighborhood before starting to check out individual apartments can reduce the amount of work with 90%. This leaves more time to identify the best deal.

In remote neighborhoods there are fewer apartments and therefore less information. This makes identifying good deals harder in such locations. However, for many people this might be the best deals. Consider this example: You want to rent in a quite neighborhood while having the option to reach venues of a special category using public transport. It is a complex problem to solve if you have no prior information regarding the city you are visiting.
